  {
    q: "How is the Roadmap different from the Senior Transition Blueprint?",
    a: "The Blueprint is the full self-serve system. You work through 20 modules on your own time, free with a free account. The Roadmap is the guided version: a detailed intake form, an intake call with Ryan, a written plan the two of you build together, a follow-up call on how to move forward, and 90 days of email support while you execute. If you want the system, start with the Blueprint. If you want the system plus someone in your corner while you run the play, apply for the Roadmap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Roadmap really free? Why?",
    a: "Yes, free. Ryan makes his living on real estate referrals, paid to him by the agent, never by the family. Families who plan the whole transition well tend to handle the house well too, and when that moment comes, we want you to talk to Ryan first. That is the business model, out in the open.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is there an application?",
    a: "Because the Roadmap is real advisory time, not a download. The intake form asks for real detail about your family, the house, the money, and the care situation, and the plan gets built with Ryan on live calls. That only works when the fit is right, so Ryan reviews each application and takes the families he can genuinely help.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I need more than 90 days of support?",
    a: "After day 90, your email support wraps up. If things change and you need help later, reach out. Most families do not need it. By day 90 they have the plan and the tools.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after the plan is built?",
    a: "The follow-up call is about how to move forward. Where the plan calls for other professionals, care, legal, financial, tax, Ryan brings in the ones that are needed, or works with the ones your family already has. If the plan includes selling the home, Ryan can find and vet the right agent and stay on the sale as your advocate, at no added cost.",

    situation:
      "I will be straight with you. I was the cash buyer on this one. Mrs. Smith was 90 with early dementia, already living two hours away with her son and his wife. Her 1970s ranch sat mostly empty except for a nephew living there rent free, while a home equity line quietly bled the family about $1,100 a month at 13 percent. They just wanted it gone, so I bought it cheap. Here is how I would walk that same family through it today, and what it would have put back in their pocket.",
    phases: [
      "First we get the family on the same page and look at the whole picture honestly. Mrs. Smith was safe with her son, but the house was the problem nobody wanted to touch: a nephew living there rent free, the equity line bleeding every month, and the place full to the ceiling. The first job is not the house, it is clarity. Stop the bleeding, get the house sold the right way, and free up money for Mrs. Smith's care as the dementia gets worse.",
      "Here is where the real money lived, and where most families get taken. The cash offer on that house was $105,000. Pay off the $32,000 still owed on the equity line and the family walks with about $73,000. Fast and clean, and it leaves a fortune on the table. The better path is simple: about $8,000 of the right work, pull the ruined carpet, refinish the hardwoods underneath, fresh paint, reglaze the dated tubs. Nothing fancy, just the work that pays back. In that market the house sells around $225,000. After the equity line, the repairs, and roughly 7 percent in selling costs, the family nets about $169,000. That is close to $96,000 more than the cash offer, for about eight grand and a few weeks of work.",
      "Mrs. Smith had already moved in with her son, so the move here was the house, not the person. We clear it out with respect, which on this one meant two full loads of her keepsakes driven the two hours to the son's home so nothing that mattered got lost. Then the light rehab, about four weeks, then list. Start to finish, roughly 90 days to a closing.",
      "This is where the team comes in, and where the house money turns into a real plan. We bring in a vetted care specialist to build Mrs. Smith a life care plan: review her Medicaid and financial options, plan for a spend-down if it ever comes to that, and stretch her money as far as it will go as the dementia progresses. Just as important, they coach the son and his wife on the caregiving itself, and respite so they do not burn out. For the rest, we work with the family's own professionals or hand pick vetted ones in their area: a financial advisor, a CPA, an elder-law attorney, and a memory care option if it is ever needed.",
      "The house sells for what it is actually worth. The family clears close to $96,000 more than the cash offer would have handed them. Mrs. Smith stays cared for, with a real plan and real money behind it, and her son and his wife have a team instead of a weight on their shoulders.",

    situation:
      "Another one where I was on the other side of the table. Ms. Jones, in her sixties, inherited a house on three acres in a quiet, desirable spot just off the main road. She never asked for it, and she was still making a mortgage payment she could not afford. She wanted out so badly that at closing she brought a check just to make the deal work, and walked away with nothing. She had her own agent, and I was the cash buyer, so I never got to tell her what I am about to tell you.",
    phases: [
      "She was drowning. An inherited property, a mortgage she did not sign up for, and no clear picture of what she actually had. The first job is to slow it down and look at the whole thing honestly, because the worst decisions in this business get made by people who just want the pain to stop. And what she had was not a tired old house. It was land, a lot more of it than anyone was treating it as.",
      "The house was a distraction. The value was in the dirt. First, sell the one lot that was already split off and ready, for about $40,000, to get cash in her hands and stop the bleeding. Use part of that to fund the real work: clear the brush off the three acres behind, bring in county surveyors to split it into three large lots, build a simple gravel road back with an easement, and bulldoze the tired house for about $10,000. When the dust settles, that is three back lots at about $65,000 each, plus two more around $40,000 each. Take out the mortgage and the costs, and she nets somewhere around $100,000. She paid $4,000 to walk away from land that, handled right, would have put roughly a hundred grand in her pocket.",
      "The order matters as much as the plan. We sell that one ready lot up front so she gets relief in weeks, not months, and so the project funds itself instead of costing her more she does not have. Then the survey and county approvals, the clearing, the road, and the lots come to market in the right sequence. I quarterback the moving parts and the closings so she is not chasing surveyors and builders on her own.",
      "She is a senior herself, and a six-figure swing changes her whole next chapter, so we plan it instead of letting it slip away. We bring in a vetted care specialist to help her think through her own aging and care plan, and we work with her own professionals or hand pick the rest of her team: a financial advisor and a CPA so a windfall like this does not turn into a tax surprise, and an estate attorney to set up her own affairs now that she finally has something to protect.",
      "She goes from writing a check just to escape, to roughly $100,000 in the bank and a real plan for the years ahead, with people in her corner. The land never changed. The only thing that changed was having someone on her side who knew what it was worth.",
    ],
    outcome:
